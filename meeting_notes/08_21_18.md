# Meeting notes - Aug. 21, 2018

## Agenda:

- Come up with data structure for persistence diagrams

## Notes:

### Questions:
- What info do we want to store and how do we want to access it?
  - What do we want to store?
  - How do we access it? 

### Review of algorithm:

- Vertices
  - Generate 2 diagrams (2D Array[5])
  - Compute 3rd direction 
  - Generate 3rd diagram
  - Store vertices (2xn Matrix i.e 2D Array)
- Edges
  - Check all pairs of vertices (Array[n] of Arrays)

## Miscellaneous

- Does our paper say it takes log(n) time to reconstruct the vertices?
